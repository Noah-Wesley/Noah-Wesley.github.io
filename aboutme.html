        <h2 class="text-center"> About Noah </h2>
	<p class = "text-center">Noah was born in Lexington, Kentucky and moved all around the country from there. He lived in Seattle, Washington for 3 years, Mooresville, North Carolina for a year and a half, and has now lived in Cincinnati, Ohio for about 9 years. From a young age, he's always enjoyed creating, planning, and building things. He became highly interested in math and science at around the age of 11, and worked hard to get into his new school's advanced algebra course as a 7th grader. He attended Walnut Hills High School from 7th grade through 12th grade. Noah faced many challenges during these years. The COVID-19 pandemic led to his school going remote for almost a year and half. This event had somewhat dampened his school and social life. However, he decided to go all in on rigorous classes during his last two years of highschool. Taking AP economics, AP Physics 1 and 2, AP Calculus BC, and many other advanced courses, he learned an incredible amount of material and began to see the world from an economic, mathematical, and engineering perspective. Noah did the GE Next Engineers program during his last 3 years of highschool, working with teammates to prototype and ultimately construct various designs.</p>
	<p class = "text-center">Noah hopes to explore engineering and business through the University Honors Program at the University of Cincinnati. In particular, he wants to design incredible products, get hands on experience working with other engineers, and help local communities solve essential everyday problems.</p>
	<p class = "text-center">In his free time, Noah enjoys programming, gaming, and fishing or hiking outdoors. His deepest passion is to help improve the quality of life for more people and help design new technology that will accelerate economic growth. His biggest strength is resourcefulness, while his biggest weakness is focusing in so hard on one thing that he misses other important things. He values Jesus, family, respect, knowledge, and freedom.</p>
